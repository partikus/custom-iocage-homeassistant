:warning: **This plugin is not actively maintained.** At this time I am no longer using TrueNAS CORE or any iocage jails. As a consequence I may not be aware of, and proactively fixing any issues that could arise. If you're having trouble with the installation of this plugin you can still open an issue and I will do my best to help. While no further development is currently planned I will continue trying to support this plugin for as long as it remains feasible.

**You may find some additional information in the [wiki](https://github.com/tprelog/iocage-homeassistant/wiki)**
