### This plugin has been removed from TrueNAS CORE

:warning: Home Assistant only supports Linux, OSX and Windows using WSL. This plugin runs in a FreeBSD jail, therefore it is not supported. As Home Assistant continues to grow and add new integrations, installation on FreeBSD no longer “just works” as it had for so many years in the past. As a consequence, it is no longer feasible to continue maintaining this plugin.
